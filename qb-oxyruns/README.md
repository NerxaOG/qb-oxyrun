qb-oxyruns
This is an edited Oxyruns script. It was orginally included within the QB framework before being removed. Lionh34rt proceeded to edit it and republish. I took Lionh34rts version and edited it including more into the script and making it feel more modern. I may build upon this in the future as I learn more code and make it better, for now, this will do. You could also easily convert this into another version of runs for pawn or such, let your imagination run wild!

- added car spawn
- added prop
- added a pay multiplier
- adjusted hand to hand deals

Shoutout to Lionh34rt for the base, and Kale with DreamScripts for all of his help and advice!!

Based on the original one script from the QBCore Framework that was edited by lionh34rt and now NerxaOG.
